# TODO for Teiserver 0.0.5
- HTTP API for creating telemetry events
- HTTP API for creating game matches
- Telemetry event export
- Match data export
- Admin UI for accounts
- Admin UI for game matches
- Controls for verification of users (work into settings for anon vs non-anon users)

# Planned
- Integration testing bots (accounts which do things like host lobbies and reply to DMs to ease testing)
- Text stream for match events in place of using rest calls (much more efficient), needs to not need auth etc
