# Planned
- Integration testing bots (accounts which do things like host lobbies and reply to DMs to ease testing)
- Text stream for match events in place of using rest calls (much more efficient), needs to not need auth etc
- Using the web interface shows you as logged in as a lite-client meaning you can use chat messages et (including a user preference to turn this off)
- Settings search in the admin interface
